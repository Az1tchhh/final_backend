# Scaling and Microservices Transition

## 1. Sharding

### Opportunities for Sharding
1. **Products Table**:
   - Shard by `category_id` for efficient product queries.
   - Example: Shard 1 for Electronics, Shard 2 for Apparel.

2. **Orders Table**:
   - Shard by `user_id` or region to distribute data evenly.

### Benefits
- Improved query performance.
- Easier horizontal scaling.

## 2. Microservices Architecture

### Key Microservices
1. **Product Service**:
   - Handles product management.
   - Manages inventory.

2. **Order Service**:
   - Handles order creation and payment.
   - Ensures transactional consistency.

3. **User Service**:
   - Handles authentication and profiles.

| Product Service   |         | Order Service        |
|                   |         |                      |
| - Products DB     |         | - Orders DB          |
+-------------------+         +----------------------+

         |                              |
         v                              v
+-----------------------------------------------+
|                 API Gateway                   |
| - Routes requests to appropriate microservice |

|    User Service   |          | External Systems  |
| - User DB         |          | - Payment Gateway |
+-------------------+          +-------------------+


## 3. Implementation Plan

### Product Management Service
- Shard products by `category_id`.
- API for fetching products by category.
